# Instagram Analysis
Certain data about the platform Instagram and the team needs meaningful understanding of some of the questions which would help team decide the further roadmap I order to get great results for the platform. This project includes User analysis which involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.
# Operating Analytics and Investigating Metrics 
In this project Various datasets and tables were given in database and my tasks was to analyze their operational activities and investigating metrics which means understanding and explaining sudden changes in standards or certain criteria for example such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. This includes working closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect. My goal is to use advanced SQL skills to analyze the data and provide valuable insights that can help improve the company's operations and understand sudden changes in key metrics.
